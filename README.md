# TNFalpha

This is a toy model to start working towards modeling effects of TNF-alpha.

We import a morphology from an SWC file, add some channels, add a stimulation, record voltage in the soma, and plot soma voltage and the shape of the morphology.

You will need to install NEURON and NetPyNE first, then you can run this simulation interactively by executing:

`ipython -i tnfa_sim.py`
